# SimAirport Modding

Documentation for the SimAirport Scripting API.

For basic modding, use the [wiki](https://github.com/lvgamedev/simairport-modding/wiki).

## Downloading

The API can be downloaded from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SimAirport.Modding/1.0.0) or manually compiled from this repository.

By default, the project file should be able to find the dependencies. If this fails, you can manually reference them by going to your `steamapps\common\SimAirport\SimAirport_Data\Managed` and manually referencing it.
